It is the story of the pilgrims on the Mayflower building a new nation. It is George Washington's cherry tree and Abraham Lincoln's log cabin. It is the fantastic tale of slaves that spontaneously teleported themselves here with nothing but strong backs and negro spirituals. It is a sugarcoated legend based on an almost true story.</p><p>It should come as no surprise that the dominant narrative of American history is blighted with errors and oversights--after all, history books were written by white men with their perspectives at the forefront. It could even be said that the devaluation and erasure of the Black experience is as American as apple pie.</p><p>In Black AF History, Michael Harriot presents a more accurate version of American history. Combining unapologetically provocative storytelling with meticulous research based on primary sources as well as the work of pioneering Black historians, scholars, and journalists, Harriot removes the white sugarcoating from the American story, placing Black people squarely at the center. With incisive wit, Harriot speaks hilarious truth to oppressive power, subverting conventional historical narratives with little-known stories about the experiences of Black Americans. From the African Americans who arrived before 1619 to the unenslavable bandit who inspired America's first police force, this long overdue corrective provides a revealing look into our past that is as urgent as it is necessary. For too long, we have refused to acknowledge that American history is white history. Not this one. This history is Black AF. </p>",Hardcover,"History, Historiography, United States, Civil War Period (1850-1877), 21st Century, Social History, African American & Black, Political Science, History & Theory, Social Science, Ethnic Studies, American, African American & Black Studies, Black Studies (Global), Race & Ethnic Relations"

Ramsey, author of the National Book Award for Nonfiction semi-finalist <i>When Crack Was King</i></b><br><br>To understand the contemporary racial wealth gap, we must first unpack the historic attacks on Indigenous and Black land ownership. From the moment that colonizers set foot on Virginian soil, a centuries-long war was waged, resulting in an existential dilemma: Who owns what on stolen land? Who owns what with stolen labor? To answer these questions, we must confront one of this nation’s first sins: stealing, hoarding, and commodifying the land.<br><br>Research suggests that between 1910 and 1997, Black Americans lost about 90% of their farmland. Land theft widened the racial wealth gap, privatized natural resources, and created a permanent barrier to access that should be a birthright for Black and Indigenous communities. <i>Rooted</i> traces the experiences of Brea Baker’s family history of devastating land loss in Kentucky and North Carolina, identifying such violence as the root of persistent inequality in this country. Ultimately, her grandparents’ commitment to Black land ownership resulted in the Bakers Acres—a haven for the family where they are sustained by the land, surrounded by love, and wholly free.<br><br>A testament to the Black farmers who dreamed of feeding, housing, and tending to their communities, <i>Rooted </i>bears witness to their commitment to freedom and reciprocal care for the land.

While Black women were aided by some activists like Sarah and Angelina Grimke and the suffrage cause found unwavering support in Frederick Douglass, many women played on the fears of white supremacists for political gain rather than take an intersectional approach to liberation. Here, Davis not only contextualizes the legacy and pitfalls of civil and women’s rights activists, but also discusses Communist women, the murder of Emmitt Till, and Margaret Sanger’s racism.

Here is the truth about love, and inspiration to help us instill caring, compassion, and strength in our homes, schools, and workplaces.</p> <p>""The word 'love' is most often defined as a noun, yet we would all love better if we used it as a verb,"" writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, renowned scholar, cultural critic, and feminist bell hooks offers a proactive new ethic for a society bereft with lovelessness--not the lack of romance, but the lack of care, compassion, and unity. People are divided, she declares, by society's failure to provide a model for learning to love. </p> <p>As bell hooks uses her incisive mind to explore the question ""What is love?"" her answers strike at both the mind and heart. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the ""100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life."" All About Love is a powerful, timely affirmation of just how profoundly her revelations can change hearts and minds for the better. </p> <p>""Each offering from bell hooks is a major event, as she has so much to give us."" -- Maya Angelou</p>",Hardcover,"Art, History, Family & Relationships, Love & Romance, Psychology, Emotions, Interpersonal Relations, Psychotherapy, Couples & Family, Self-Help, Personal Growth, Social Science, Ethnic Studies, American, African American & Black Studies, Popular Culture, Sociology, Women's Studies, Gender Studies"

9780966170221,5,2,PowerNomics : The National Plan to Empower Black America,Dr. Claud Anderson,Powernomics Corp of Amer,Non-Fiction,"Product Description<br/><br/>PowerNomics: The National Plan to Empower Black America is a five-year plan to make Black America a prosperous and empowered race that is self-sufficient and competitive as a group by the year 2005. In this book, Dr. Anderson obliterates the myths and illusions of black progress and brings together data and information from many different sources to construct a framework for solutions to the dilemma of Black America. In PowerNomics: The National Plan, Dr. Anderson proposes new principles, strategies and concepts that show blacks a new way to see, think, and behave in race matters. The new mind set prepares blacks to take strategic steps to create a new reality for their race. It offers guidance to others who support blacks self-sufficiency. In this book, Dr. Anderson offers insightful analysis and action steps blacks can take to redesign core areas of life - Education, Economics, Politics and Religion - to better benefit their race. The action steps in each area require new empowerment tools that Dr. Anderson presents - a new group vision and a new culture of empowerment - tools designed to counter, if not break many of the racial monopolies in society. Vertical integration and Industrializing black communities are other major concepts and strategies that he presents in the book. He places a great deal of importance on building industries in black communities that are constructed upon group competitive advantages. A the same time he announced the release of PowerNomics: The National Plan, he also announced that he has established several models of the strategies he proposes in the book. PowerNomics: The Plan, is infused with Dr. Anderson's trademark creative thinking and answers questions such as: - Why are blacks the only group that equates success with working in a White corporation, government or the entertainment industry? - How did power and wealth - businesses, resources, privileges, income and control of all levels of government get so disproportionately distributed into the hands of White society?<br/>- Industrialization brings many economic benefits to the geographic locations where it occurs. Why has Black America never been industrialized and how can it be done? - Why do visible blacks and black leaders avoid blackness, identifying the focus of their work instead for people of color, minorities, women, gays , the poor, Hispanics, and other immigrant groups? - What enables a constant stream of immigrant groups to politically, economically and socially dominate blacks? - In politics, how is it that blacks can be monolithic and loyal political supporters yet their group receives no quid pro quo benefits? - In his first book, Black Labor, White Wealth, Dr. Anderson examined history and showed how racism has locked and boxed blacks into a near permanent underclass. Picking up where Black Labor, White Wealth left off, PowerNomics: The National Plan is the missing link between the historical analysis of problems facing blacks and the strategies needed to correct those problems. Dr. Anderson's books are a phenomenon in the publishing industry. His work is distinguished because he has turned books that are serious, non-fiction, and heavy on black history, into best-sellers. PowerNomics: The National Plan continues that pattern. It is an astounding work.<br/><br/>About the Author<br/><br/>Dr. Claud Anderson is a noted black author who has successfully implemented social and economic change throughout his career. His unique background of experience is reflected in PowerNomics: The National Plan. To implement the strategy of industrializing Black communities, he has established a vertically integrated seafood industry that is currently operating and will expand into urban areas across the nation. His company is one of the few black-owned companies to make stock available to the general public through an initial public offering. In addition to his most recent seafood project, he owns a vertically integrated publishing company a",Hardcover,"AFRICAN AMERICANS_ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AFRICAN AMERICANS IN BUSINESS"

Hemphill, an expert embodiment practitioner, therapist, and activist who has partnered with Brené Brown, Tarana Burke, and Esther Perel, among others, demonstrates a future in which healing is done in community. Hemphill weaves together stories from their own experience as a trauma survivor with clinical accounts and lessons learned from their time as a social movement architect. They ask, “What would it do to movements, to our society and culture, to have the principles of healing at the very center? And what does it do to have healing at the center of every structure and everything we create?”<br><br>In this life-affirming framework for the way forward, Hemphill shows us how to heal our bodies, minds, and souls—to develop the interpersonal skills necessary to break down the doors of disconnection and take the necessary risks to reshape our world toward justice.",Hardcover,"Psychology, Psychopathology, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Social Science, Activism & Social Justice, Biography & Autobiography, Personal Memoirs"
9780063212077,3,2,Positive Obsession The Life and Times of Octavia E. Butler,Susana M. Morris,HarperCollins Publishers,Non-Fiction,"<br> <br> <p>A magnificent cultural biography that charts the life of one of our greatest writers, situating her alongside the key historical and social moments that shaped her work. </p> <p>As the first Black woman to consistently write and publish in the field of science fiction, Octavia Butler was a trailblazer. With her deft pen, she created stories speculating the devolution of the American empire, using it as an apt metaphor for the best and worst of humanity--our innovation and ingenuity, our naked greed and ambition, our propensity for violence and hierarchy. Her fiction charts the rise and fall of the American project--the nation's transformation from a provincial backwater to a capitalist juggernaut--made possible by chattel slavery--to a bloated imperialist superpower on the verge of implosion. </p> <p>In this outstanding work, Susana M. Morris places Butler's story firmly within the cultural, social, and historical context that shaped her life: the Civil Rights Movement, Black Power, women's liberation, queer rights, Reaganomics. Morris reveals how these influences profoundly impacted Butler's personal and intellectual trajectory and shaped the ideas central to her writing. Her cautionary tales warn us about succumbing to fascism, gender-based violence, and climate chaos while offering alternate paradigms to religion, family, and understanding our relationships to ourselves. Butler envisioned futures with Black women at the center, raising our awareness of how those who are often dismissed have the knowledge to shift the landscape of our world. But her characters are no magical martyrs, they are tough, flawed, intelligent, and complicated, a reflection of Butler's stories. </p> <p>Morris explains what drove Butler: She wrote because she felt she must. ""Who was I anyway Why should anyone pay attention to what I had to say Did I have anything to say I was writing science fiction and fantasy, for God's sake. At that time nearly all professional science-fiction writers were white men. As much as I loved science fiction and fantasy, what was I doing Well, whatever it was, I couldn't stop. Positive obsession is about not being able to stop just because you're afraid and full of doubts. Positive obsession is dangerous. It's about not being able to stop at all."" </p>",Hardcover,"Biographies & Memoirs, Arts & Literature, Community & Culture, Black & African American"

Volume 1,"Ronald Dalton, Ronald Dalton Jr",G Publishing LLC,Non-Fiction,"THE GREATEST IDENTIY THEFT OF ALL MAKIND HAS HAPPENED WITHOUT THE WORLD EVEN KNOWING IT. We all know who the ""Jews"" today in the world are. They came to Israel in 1948 from Europe almost 2,000 years after the destruction of the 2nd Temple in Jerusalem. But who are they? The Bible says the ""Children of Israel"" would endure Curses ""forever"" for not keeping his commandments. This is in the Torah (First 5 books of the Old Testament). The New Testament talks about a ""Physical Israel"" and a ""Spiritual Israel"". What's the difference? We know the Chaldeans claim heritage from the Ancient Chaldeans in the Land of Ur that Abraham lived amongst. We know the Greeks claim heritage from the Grecians of old like ""Alexander the Great."" We know Arabs today claim heritage from Abraham's son Ishmael. What has baffled mankind is the whereabouts of the Biblical ""Hebrew Israelites"" aka the ""Children of Israel?"" In our Bible God laid out clues as to who they were THEN and TODAY but for centuries we have ignored the ""clues"". Satan has cleverly used mankind to sweep under the rug the ""True Identity"" of the Biblical Hebrew Israelites so that we cannot discover where their descendants are at. In Israel and all throughout the world, it is a known fact that Modern Jewry only claims to be from the Tribe of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi. No one talks about why these Tribes are supposedly ""FOUND"" while the other Tribes are mysteriously ""LOST"". Well, in ""Hebrews to Negroes 2: Wake Up Black America, Volume 1"" the answer to this question is finally going to be revealed. The Bible makes certain things clear that cannot be refuted: - The Curses of Israel were ""DIVINE PUNISHMENTS"" for the Children of Israel for disobeying God's commandments ALL throughout their history in the bible even until the last book of the Old Testament, ""Malachi"" (Deuteronomy 28:16-68). - These ""Curses"" were going to be ONLY FOR THE ISRAELITES and THEIR CHILDREN FOREVER (Deuteronomy 28:46). - The ""Children of Israel"" DID in fact DISOBEY God's Commandments and ACKNOWLEDGED that they had RECEIVED the Curses (Daniel 9:9-14). - God promised to one day REGATHER THE DESCENDANTS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL to their land to enjoy PEACE, REST, QUIET, and NO FEAR (Jeremiah 30:10-12, Ezekiel 11:16-17, Isaiah 11:11-12, Isaiah 43:5-7). This has not been the case in Israel since the State of Israel was born in 1948. - After the ""Fall of the Second Temple"" in Jerusalem in 70 A.D., the remaining Israelites would be scattered by way of CAPTIVITY into ALL NATIONS, and the GENTILES would possess Jerusalem (Israel) until the second coming of Christ (Luke 21:24-28).

The future of storytelling is here.</p> <p>Disabled, disinclined to marry, and more interested in writing than a lucrative career in medicine or law, Zelu has always felt like the outcast of her large Nigerian family. Then her life is upended when, in the middle of her sister's lavish Caribbean wedding, she's unceremoniously fired from her university job and, to add insult to injury, her novel is rejected by yet another publisher. With her career and dreams crushed in one fell swoop, she decides to write something just for herself. What comes out is nothing like the quiet, literary novels that have so far peppered her unremarkable career. It's a far-future epic where androids and AI wage war in the grown-over ruins of human civilization. She calls it Rusted Robots.</p> <p>When Zelu finds the courage to share her strange novel, she does not realize she is about to embark on a life-altering journey--one that will catapult her into literary stardom, but also perhaps obliterate everything her book was meant to be. From Chicago to Lagos to the far reaches of space, Zelu's novel will change the future not only for humanity, but for the robots who come next.</p> <p>A book-within-a-book that blends the line between writing and being written, Death of the Author is a masterpiece of metafiction that manages to combine the razor-sharp commentary of Yellowface with the heartfelt humanity of Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow. Surprisingly funny, deeply poignant, and endlessly discussable, this is at once the tale of a woman on the margins risking everything to be heard and a testament to the power of storytelling to shape the world as we know it. </p> <p>""An ambitious, inventive tribute to the power of storytelling itself."" -- Nikki Erlick, New York Times bestselling author of The Measure</p> <p>""A deeply felt dazzle.

Consider how racism, sexism, and classism make hierarchies, exploitation, and violence seem natural and inevitable--but all emerged from the human imagination.</p> <p>The most effective way to disrupt these deadly systems is to do so collectively. Benjamin highlights the educators, artists, activists, and many others who are refuting powerful narratives that justify the status quo, crafting new stories that reflect our interconnection, and offering creative approaches to seemingly intractable problems.</p> <p>Imagination: A Manifesto offers visionary examples and tactics to push beyond the constraints of what we think, and are told, is possible. This book is for anyone who is ready to take to heart Toni Morrison's instruction: ""Dream a little before you think.""</p>",Paperback,"Family & Relationships, Political Science, Political Ideologies, Capitalism, Social Science, Ethnic Studies, American, African American & Black Studies, Technology Studies, Activism & Social Justice"

In his memoir, Iverson explores how he completely shattered the mold dictating what an NBA star could be in the 1990s and 2000s, all while dealing with legal troubles and personal traumas that only contributed to his sense of individualism and star power. This is the unforgettable story of a trailblazer who not only changed the game of basketball but rewrote the rules of what it means to rise, fall, and rise again while staying unapologetically true to himself.",Hardcover,"Biographies & Memoirs, Memoirs, History, Americas, United States, Sports & Outdoors, Basketball, Biographies"
